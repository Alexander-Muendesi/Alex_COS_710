# Project Description
Each branch contains a Genetic Program implementation to solve the Seoul Bike Trip duration problem. This dataset can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gtfh9z865f/1. 
Note that a subset of the dataset was used, namely the first 150 000 data items where used as the data set for the project.

# feature/geneticProgram branch
This branch contains the canonical GP implementation.

# feature/structureGP
This branch contains a structure based GP implementation

# feature/GrammaticalEvolution
This branch contains a Grammatical Evolution genetic program to solve the Seoul Bike Trip duration problem

# Running the program
This code was created in VS Code. The Java Project makes use of no build tools and can be run by clicking the run button on the top right of VS Code.
